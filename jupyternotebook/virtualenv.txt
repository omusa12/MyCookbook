Create a virtual environment
===========================================================
Note: I like to use a . in front of my virtual environments
so the folder is hidden.

>>>virtualenv .venv

Get inside the environment
>>>.venv/scripts/activate
You can verify quickly you are in the environment by running which python which will return the path of the python executable in the environment if all went well
which python
>>> xxxxx/.venv/bin/python

Install a Jupyter kernel
============================================================
This will install a kernel inside the environment, to use to run in the Jupyter notebook there:
>>>ipython kernel install --user --name=.venv

Run Jupyter, and select the .venv kernel to run the notebook
>>>jupyter notebook
